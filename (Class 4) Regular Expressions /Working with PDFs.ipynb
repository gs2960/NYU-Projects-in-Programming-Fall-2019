      "FOREWORDThis Manual of statistical procedures is intended for use by scientistsand engineers. However, especially iii the planning stages of tests andexperiments, it is advisable to supplement the information by occasionalconsultations with statisticians.The proper use of modern statistical methods provides not merely aprecise summary of the conclusions that may be drawn from an experimentalready performed but also, with a small amount of prior information orby making reasonable assumptions, a reliable prediction of the informationthat can be gained from a proposed experiment. The latter feature has tosome extent already placed the planning of tests and experiments on asubstantially more rational basis, and further progress can be expectedin the future.Although the Manual is not intended to be a textbook or treatise on theone hand, or merely a set of tables on the other, it is rendered somewhatself-contained by the inclusion of Chapter 1, Definitions and Distributions,and the Appendix table., and charts. Attention is called particularly toAppendix Table 8, which enables confidence limits for a standard devia-tion to be obtained immediately, and to Charts 1I--X, which facilitate thedetermination of the sample sizes required for various experiments.The preparation of the Manual was first undertaken at the Naval Ord-nance Test Station in 1948, under Task Assignment NOTS-36-Re3d-439-3,as authorized by Bureau of Ordnance letter NP36(Re3d)AAF:bc dated26 October 1948, which also provided for the basic statistical study of theprograms of the Station. Work on the manuscript was not completed atthe termination of this task assignment, and the continuation of its prep-aration from 1950 to 1955 was supported by funds from explorto,-y andfoundational research and general overhead. Although the book wasprepared primarily for uise at the Station, it may well be of value at otherDepartment of Defense establishments.iii\n"
